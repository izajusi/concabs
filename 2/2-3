Procedure:

```scheme
(define square ; another version that doesnâ€™t work
  (lambda (n)
    (if (= n 0)
        0
        (+ (square (- n 2))
           (- (* 4 n) 4)))))
```

Base case:
`(square 0)` terminates with the value of 0.

Induction hypothesis:
Assume `(square k)` terminates with the value k^2 for all k in the range 0 <= k <= n.

Inductive step:
Consider evaluating `(square n)`, with n > 0: 

- This will terminate if the evaluation of `(square (- n 2))` does, and;
- Will have the the same the same value as `(+ (square (- n 2)) (- (* 4 n) 4))`.

`(- n 2)` evaluates to n - 2. Since `(- n 2)` < 0 for the value of n = 1, then based on our induction hypothesis, then this function will not terminate.
