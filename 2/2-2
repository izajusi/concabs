Procedure:

```scheme
(define factorial
  (lambda (n)
    (if (= n 1)
        1
        (* (factorial (- n 1))
           n))))
```

Base case:
`(factorial 1)` terminates with the value of 1.

Induction hypothesis:
Assume `(factorial k)` terminates with the value k! for all k in the range 1 <= k <= n.

Inductive step:
Consider evaluating `(factorial n)` with n > 1:

- This will terminate if the evaluation of `(factorial (- n 1))` does, and;
- Will have the same value as `(* (factorial (- n 1)) n)`.

Because `(- n 1)` evaluates to n - 1 and 1 <= n - 1 <= n, we can therefore assume by our induction hypothesis that `(factorial (- n 1))` does terminate, with the value of (n - 1)!.

Therefore `(* (factorial (- n 1)) n)` evaluates to (n * (n - 1)!), which will expand to (n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) * ... * 1), which satisfies the definition of n!.

Conclusion:
Therefore, by mathematical induction on n, `(factorial n)` terminates with the value of n! for all n > 1.
